## Notes
It was exciting to build app on android. I got familiar with different approaches one can use to 
implement the feature. However, pushing project to Github was new to me. I made use of command line
tools, yet kept on getting error "Your repository already exists", although I had explicitly deleted 
that directory. One of friends suggested me to go through VCS->Import into Version Control to share 
project on github. This saved my time further. I will keep on updating app to enhance it further.
