# Pre-work - *ListDemo*

**ListDemo** is an android app that allows building a todo list and basic todo items management functionality 
including adding new items, editing and deleting an existing item.

Submitted by **Priyanka Eratkar**

Time Spent: **20** hours

## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is completed:

* User can **successfully add and remove items** from the todo list
* User can **tap a todo item in the list and bring up an edit screen for the todo item** and then have any changes to the text reflected in the todo list.
* User can **persist todo items** and retrieve them properly on app restart

The following **optional** functionality is completed:
* Persist the todo items [into SQLite](http://guides.codepath.com/android/Persisting-Data-to-the-Device#sqlite) instead of a text file
* Improve style of the todo items in the list [using a custom adapter] *Cursor Adpater* (http://guides.codepath.com/android/Using-an-ArrayAdapter-with-ListView) 
* Add support for completion due dates for todo items (and display within listview item)
* Use a [DialogFragment](http://guides.codepath.com/android/Using-DialogFragment) instead of new Activity to confirm item deletion
* Add support for selecting the priority of each todo item 
* Tweak the style improving the UI / UX, play with colors, images or backgrounds

The following **additional** features are implemented:
* Use a [DialogFragment](http://guides.codepath.com/android/Using-DialogFragment) for getting user confirmation to delete an item from todo list
* Model classes to access dataâ€¨
* Spinner for priority select
* Datepicker
* Reusable Activity to Add and Delete todo item

## Notes
It was exciting to build app on android. I got familiar with different approaches one can use to 
implement the feature. However, pushing project to Github was new to me. I made use of command line
tools, yet kept on getting error "Your repository already exists", although I had explicitly deleted 
that directory. One of friends suggested me to go through VCS->Import into Version Control to share 
project on github. This saved my time further. I will keep on updating app to enhance it further.
